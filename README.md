This project successfully demonstrated the power of integrating multiple advanced technologies to create a comprehensive pipeline for video summarization and facial analysis. The workflow, designed for efficiency 
and accuracy, encompasses the following key steps:
1.	Video Acquisition: Utilizing Pytube, we seamlessly extracted videos from YouTube, providing the foundation for further processing.
2.	Frame Extraction: OpenCV, a versatile computer vision library, enabled us to extract individual frames from the videos, preparing the data for subsequent analysis.
3.	Object Detection: The state-of-the-art YOLO algorithm was employed to accurately identify and segment key objects and scenes within each frame, offering a detailed visual understanding of the content.
4.	Generative AI Summarization: The Gemini Large Language Model (LLM) was leveraged to generate coherent and contextually rich summaries based on the detected objects and scenes, demonstrating the power of
                                 generative AI in comprehending and summarizing visual content.
5.	Facial Analysis: DeepFace, a powerful facial analysis tool, was utilized to extract detailed insights from detected faces, including age, gender, emotion, and race, providing valuable information for various
                     applications.
